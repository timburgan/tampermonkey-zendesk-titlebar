# tampermonkey-zendesk-titlebar

This script will update the ZenDesk tab titlebar to be similar to the following:

At a glance, this shows the ticket status (`N` for New, `O` for Open, `S` for Solved, `H` for On-Hold), the ticket number and the ticket title. This is instead of the default title that ZenDesk shows... which is the same thing no matter what page or ticket you're viewing.

I use the **Tampermonkey** addon ([Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/), [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo), [Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/tampermonkey/iikmkjmpaadaobahmlepeloendndfphd)) within my browser. I've added the script within this repo and pasted it into the `Create new script` within Tampermonkey.
